##Installing rbenv

### Why version control Ruby?

Out-of-date programmer Ollie uses Ruby 1.9.

Ollie is coding one day in an old project and realizes there's a really cool method he wants to use (for example, [#to_h][#to_h] to turn an object into a hash).

But ruby 1.9 doesn't have #to_h!  Ruby 2.0 does have #to_h.

Wouldn't it be great if Ollie could switch between ruby versions easily?  What if Ollie has tons of different projects using different ruby versions?

### Enter Rbenv
[RBenv][RBenv] keeps track of which version of Ruby you're using.

## For Windows:

- You're out of luck--there's no RBenv.  Try following the "Windows Systems" instructions for [uru][uru].  *<sub><sup>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not

### For Mac OS X:

1.  Open terminal
2.  Copy, paste, and run the following, one line at a time:
  - `sudo rvm implode`
    - If it says `sudo: rvm: command not found`, that's fine.
  - `sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm`
  - `brew ls --versions rbenv`
3. If nothing shows up after you run "brew ls --versions rbenv", copy, paste, and run the following:
  - `brew install rbenv`
  - `brew install ruby-build`
4. Copy, paste, and run:
  - `open ~/.bash_profile`
5. In the text editor:
  - Search (command+F) for "rvm", and delete any lines that have it.
  - Copy and paste the following at the bottom:
  ```
    export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
    if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi

  ```
  - Save and quit.
6. Copy, paste, and run:
  - `rbenv install 2.1.2`
  - `rbenv global 2.1.2`


Try running a ruby program to test!
