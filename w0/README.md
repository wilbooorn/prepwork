# Week 0: Getting Started

### Switching to Ruby
This course will require you to work in Ruby. If you have a programming
background in a different language, make sure you are familiar with Ruby
before getting started. We recommend JumpstartLabs's Ruby in 100 Minutes as a quick way
to get up to speed.
