# Week 4: Basic Rails and Assessment Prep

### Solo Project: [Jumpstart Blogger][jumpstart-blogger]

**NOTE**: Jumpstart blogger makes you install rvm, which we don't recommend.
In the "Environment Setup" section, skip the "RVM" and "Ruby" sections.  Instead, do steps 4 and 5 of [these instructions][RBEnv setup].

If you already installed rvm (run `rvm list rubies` in terminal, if it doesn't say "command not found", you've installed it), do all the steps of [these instructions][RBEnv setup].
