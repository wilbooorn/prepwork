### Resume Writing: [Prepare your Resume][resume]
###### *(Make sure you complete this and send it to us before your first day!)*
(If you've been conditionally accepted, this is not required yet.)

### Solo Project: [Jumpstart Blogger][jumpstart-blogger]

**NOTE**: Jumpstart blogger makes you install rvm, which we don't recommend.
In the "Environment Setup" section, skip the "RVM" and "Ruby" sections.  Instead, do steps 3-6 of [these instructions][RBEnv setup].

If you already installed rvm (to check: run `rvm list rubies` in terminal, if it doesn't say "command not found", you've installed it), do all the steps of [these instructions][RBEnv setup].
