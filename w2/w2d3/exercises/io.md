# I/O Exercises

* Write a number guessing game. The computer should choose a number
  between 1 and 100. It should prompt the user for guesses. Each
  time, it will prompt the user for a guess; it will return too high
  or too low. It should track the number of guesses the player took.
* Write a program that prompts the user for a file name, reads that
  file, shuffles the lines, and saves it to the file
  "{input_name}-shuffled.txt". You could create a random number using
  the Random class, or you could use the `shuffle` method in array.
