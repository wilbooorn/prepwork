# Workflow

### Step 1: Do the Readings
* Read the day's readings before the start of class time.
* Read the instructions for the day's exercises and projects before the
  start of class.
* Do NOT start the day's exercises or projects before the start of
  class.

### Step 2: Complete the Exercises
Work through the exercises and projects in the order presented. If
you're pair programming, make sure to switch roles regularly. Don't
worry if the material is difficult or you get stuck--looking things up
is a necessary part of writing code. Good resources include your
TAs, classmates, Google, and Stack Overflow. Remember, however, that
this isn't a race: you should make an effort to understand everything
deeply before moving on to the next step.

### Step 3: Refactor
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without
changing its behavior. Your first approach to a problem will never be
ideal; going back and refactoring your code is a good way to clean
things up, try new patterns, implement best practices, and become a
better programmer overall. Refactor as much as you have time for, and
strive to become a better coder than your past self. :)

### Step 4: Read the Solutions
Do this after class hours are over (never before). Ideally you should
finish your own implementation and spend at least some time refactoring
before you look at the solutions. If you "peek ahead" at the solutions,
you are only hurting yourself. The concepts will stick much better if
you master them through personal effort.

### Step 5: Give Feedback
At the end of each day, you will be asked to give feedback on your
partner (if you had one), as well as the organization of the material
and the effectiveness of instruction. Since this part of the course is
still in beta, we're still working to fine-tune it. Please let us know
what works well and what could be improved!
