# Pair Programming Setup

On the day of a pair project, you will be sent an email with the list of
pairs for the day. Find your name in the left-most column of the email;
on the right, you will find the name and email of your partner. Get in
touch and follow these steps to get started:

0. Sign in to [Floobits][floobits] using your Github username.
0. Decide which partner will be the "host" the pairing session. Both
   partners will work in the host's workspace.
0. The host should add the "guest" as an editor on the workspace.
  * Click on the "Settings" button for the workspace.
  * Click "Edit Permissions" under the "Workspace Permissions" heading.
  * Add the guest (you should be able to search for their Github
    username), and provide "Edit" and "View" permissions.
0. The host should send the workspace link to the guest; at this point,
   both participants should be able to enter code into the workspace.
0. Use Skype or the integrated voice chat in Floobits to communicate and
   collaborate with your partner.
0. Remember to follow the [pair programming
   guidelines][pair-programming]!
