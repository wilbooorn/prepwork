# App Academy Code of Conduct 

The App Academy community is based on two foundational principles: integrity in your work and respect for others in the community.  As an App Academy student, you are expected to abide by these principles at all times.  Repeated failure to integrate these principles into your words and actions will result in your dismissal from App Academy.  

## Principle #1: Integrity in Your Work 

App Academy is a rigorous, difficult program.  The only way to succeed at a/A is to give the daily assignments, readings, and lectures your full attention and focus.  Additionally, the amount of effort you put into your work affects your fellow students' ability to learn and excel.  For these reasons, we require that you abide by the following guidelines while at App Academy.

#### Academic Integrity Guidelines 

1. **Be on time.**  During the coding curriculum (that is, the first 9 weeks of the program), roll is called promptly at 9am, after lunch at 1:30pm, and after the afternoon break (usually at 4:15pm, although this may vary by day).  To fully participate in the day's work, you must be on time for each of these calls.  

2. **Complete your work.**  To the very best of your ability, you must complete all assigned readings, coding challenges and projects, and video lectures in a timely manner.  Failing to do the readings or view the lectures for the following day pulls not only you, but your coding partner for the day down.  Additionally, App Academy's curriculum is cumulative -- if you fall behind, you will continue to find yourself more and more behind as the program progresses.  Stay on top of the work.

3. **Prioritize understanding over brute force completion.**  This guideline may seem counterintuititve to the previous guideline, but what matters most in this program is firm understanding of the concepts at hand.  If you must make a choice between completion without understanding, and understanding without completion, always choose the latter.  What is not acceptable is to walk away from your work without making every effort to thoroughly understand and complete the tasks at hand.  

4. **Ask for help when you need it.**  You will be challenged at App Academy.  You will, at some point, be confused and lost.  This is normal and natural.  We want you to make every effort to understand on your own, but if you find yourself stuck, we also want (and require) you to ask for help from TAs, instructors, and your fellow students, so that you do not fall behind.

#### Consequences and Accountability 

**Assessments.**  During the coding curriculum, you will take a total of six assessments.  These assessments are designed to gauge how well you've mastered the material and whether or not you're keeping up with the work.  Failing two assessments is grounds for dismissal from App Academy.

**Coding Curriculum Strikes.**  In addition to assessments, instructors and TAs may assign "strikes" for behaviors in violation of the guidelines outlined above.  Strike-worthy offenses include (but are not limited to) missing roll call, having your phone or laptop out during class time, and failure to turn in required assignments.  Accruing 10 strikes during the 9-week coding curriculum is grounds for dismissal.  

**Job Search Curriculum Strikes.**  After the conclusion of the 9-week coding curriculum, you will enter the job search curriculum.  Your coding curriculum strikes will be nullified at this time, and you will become accountable to the job search strike system until you either find a job, or 1 year has passed.  

Strike-worthy offenses during the job search curriculum include (but are not limited to) failure to respond to emails from your career coach, missing roll call, missing deadlines set by your career coach, and moving out of the job search area (SF or NYC) without the approval of your coach.  Your strike count will reduce by 1 strike each week during the job search curriculum; accruing 5 strikes is grounds for App Academy to change your tuition model to a flat-rate $18,000 rather than 18% of your first year's salary. 

## Principle #2: Respect for Others 

App Academy strives to provide an environment that is safe and supportive for all students.  As a part of the a/A community, we expect that you will help to create such an environment for your peers.  Creating such a space is simultaneously simple and complex; the core principle of respect for every other person in this space is what should guide your behavior.  At times, it may not be clear to you how to best act out that respect.  We ask that all students mold their behavior and words to the following guidelines:

1. **Treat your coding partners with professionality.**  You will spend the vast majority of your time at App Academy pair programming, usually with a new partner each day.  You may not like each person you work with; you won't want to be friends with each and every one of your coding partners.  However, you are expected to treat each other with the same professionalism you would treat a colleague in the workplace.  If you encounter conflict, we expect you to address it in a mature, respectful way, just as you would on the job.  If you find yourself unable to come to a resolution, App Academy TAs and instructors can act as mediators -- however, we encourage you to view difficult partner experiences as practice for the professional world, and make every effort to come to a consensus before getting staff involved. 

2. **Take feedback with grace.**  In the intense App Academy environment, all of our flaws and bad habits tend to surface.  If a fellow student or a staff member points out an area in which you can improve either technically or interpersonally, we expect that you will listen with open ears and incorporate this feedback into your work and behavior as best as possible.  Defensiveness is not productive and has no place at App Academy.  We encourage you to view these moments as challenges to be faced head-on; constructive feedback is a gift to you and gives you a chance to reflect and improve.  

3. **Give feedback with empathy.**  Receiving critical feedback can be challenging, and we expect you to recognize that when offering it.  Before approaching a fellow student with advice for improvement, reflect thoughtfully and find phrasing that tells your peer three things: concrete example(s) of their problematic behavior, the way(s) in which this behavior impacted you as a partner or peer, and concrete actions they can take in the future to improve upon this behavior.  If you are struggling to find the right words, App Academy staff are available as sounding boards.  

4. **Exercise self-awareness in your interactions with others.**  It is very easy to become self-involved and tunnel-visioned in the midst of the intense stress and workload of App Academy.  We expect, however, that you will take on the additional challenge of maintaining a high level of empathy and self-awareness towards your fellow students.  Ask yourself frequently how your words and actions are affecting the people around you.  Reflect on your own biases (which we all hold); are you treating people differently based on a characteristic such as gender, physical appearance, race, or something else?  If you find this to be the case, step back and think about how you can do better.  

5. **Treat the a/A workspace as you would a professional working environment.**  We expect that you will treat the App Academy office, including the student workspace, the lounge area, the lecture area, and all other spaces, just as you would your desk or office at your job.  Clean up after yourself, don't make excessive noise, and don't cause damage to any property.

6. **Treat every member of the a/A community with a high level of respect, as you would want to be treated.**  All members of our community -- staff, students, and alumni -- are expected to treat all others in the community respectfully, regardless of their backgrounds, performance in the course, interpersonal conflicts that may have arisen in the past, or any personal characteristics such as gender, race, sexual orientation, trans status, religion, national origin, body size or shape, or disability status.
