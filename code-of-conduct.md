# App Academy Code of Conduct 

The App Academy community is based on two foundational principles: integrity in your work and respect for others in the community.  As an App Academy student, you are expected to abide by these principles at all times.  Repeated failure to integrate these principles into your words and actions will result in your dismissal from App Academy.  

## Integrity in Your Work 

App Academy is a rigorous, difficult program.  The only way to succeed at a/A is to give the daily assignments, readings, and lectures your full attention and focus.  Additionally, the amount of effort you put into your work affects your fellow students' ability to learn and excel.  For these reasons, we require that you abide by the following guidelines while at App Academy:

**Be on time.**  During the coding curriculum (that is, the first 9 weeks of the program), roll is called promptly at 9am, after lunch at 1:30pm, and after the afternoon break (usually at 4:15pm, although this may vary by day).  To fully participate in the day's work, you must be on time for each of these calls.  

**Complete your work.**  To the very best of your ability, you must complete all assigned readings, coding challenges and projects, and video lectures in a timely manner.  Failing to do the readings or view the lectures for the following day pulls not only you, but your coding partner for the day down.  Additionally, App Academy's curriculum is cumulative -- if you fall behind, you will continue to find yourself more and more behind as the program progresses.  Stay on top of the work.

**Prioritize understanding over brute force completion.**  This guideline may seem counterintuititve to the previous guideline, but what matters most in this program is firm understanding of the concepts at hand.  If you must make a choice between completion without understanding, and understanding without completion, always choose the latter.  What is not acceptable is to walk away from your work without making every effort to thoroughly understand and complete the tasks at hand.  

**Ask for help when you need it.**  You will be challenged at App Academy.  You will, at some point, be confused and lost.  This is normal and natural.  We want you to make every effort to understand on your own, but if you find yourself stuck, we also want (and require) you to ask for help from TAs, instructors, and your fellow students, so that you do not fall behind.

## Consequences and Accountability 

## Respect for Others 

App Academy strives to provide an environment that is safe and supportive for all students.  As a part of the a/A community, we expect that you will help to create such an environment for your peers.  Creating such a space is simultaneously simple and complex; the core principle of respect for every other person in this space is what should guide your behavior.  At times, it may not be clear to you how to best act out that respect.  We ask that all students mold their behavior and words to the following guidelines:

1. **Treat your coding partners with professionality.**
