You've written an RPN calculator. Practice by rewriting your version
better than you had before. It should have a user interface which reads
from standard input one operand or operator at a time. You should be
able to invoke it as a script from the command line. You should be able
to, optionally, give it a filename on the command line, in which case it
opens and reads that file instead of reading user input.

* `5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -` should return `14`
