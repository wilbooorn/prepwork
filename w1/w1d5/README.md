# W1D5: Test-First Ruby (Part I)

Time for some more Test-First Ruby! Today's material is designed to help
you review what you've learned over the last week. Since it includes
RSpec tests, it will also be good practice for your first assessment.

### Getting Started

The setup process is essentially unchanged from last night's pair
project.
Download the [zip][w1d5-zip] containing the day's exercises. Extract it
to a directory in your workspace and navigate there in your terminal
(for example, `cd ~/my_workspace/w1d5`). As before, run `bundle
install`. Write your code in the `lib` folder, run the specs
periodically to gauge your progress, and use the "Red, Green, Refactor"
workflow described earlier. The `spec` files contain comments (as well
as the specs themselves) to guide you. Good luck!

[w1d5-zip]: ./w1d5.zip
