# Week 1: Basic Object-Oriented Programming

This week's coursework will teach you the basic building blocks of Ruby...
something.... By the end of the week, you should know how to work with all
of Ruby's basic data types, and should understand the fundamentals of working
with classes.

Before you begin, make sure to review the [daily workflow][workflow]. Complete
the readings, work through the exercises, refactor your code, and make sure
you understand the provided solutions before you continue.
