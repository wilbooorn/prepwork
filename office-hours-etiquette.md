# Office Hours Etiquette

## Answering Classmates' Questions
Slack is a great resource where you can talk with your fellow classmates
about the prep work and help each other out on the tougher concepts.
You're all doing the prep work together, so if you're struggling to wrap
your head around something, your cohort-mates will usually be willing to 
explain what they understand. The reverse also holds: sometimes you'll be 
the one who understands a concept that someone else is having trouble with.
You're encouraged to try to explain it as this is a great learning opportunity
for both you and the other student.

However, the hours of 6-8PM (ET for NY and PST for San Francisco) are reserved
for TA office hours. During that time, questions on Slack should only be answered 
by the instructional staff, as having multiple people answering the same questions 
at the same time can get distracting.

## Question Format

Most of the questions you'll have will probably be about specific things in your
code or in our code examples. Please send the code you have a question about along
with the question. If you have an error, send the output of the error as well. 
This will help us narrow down how to best answer your question.
