Welcome to App Academy Prep! This course is designed to be completed
part-time, online, while you are employed, and should take four weeks to
complete. The course will take 15-20 hours a week; it will cover the
fundamentals of Ruby programming. TAs will hold office hours on
Monday-Thursday evenings; during that time, you have their undivided
attention. Take advantage of this resource and ask questions!

While you do not need to submit your prep work for review, we expect
 students to complete the full prep course before class begins.

## Feedback

During App Academy Prep, we will ask you to give feedback on your
experience completing the project. You'll be asked to evaluate your
performance and understanding, as well as your interactions with the
instructional staff. We will also collect similar data during the
course. Your feedback helps us to improve the course and keep track of
how well people are keeping up with the material.

## Schedule

App Academy Prep will span four weeks. You will be expected to do
readings and complete coding exercises each weeknight. We expect this
work to take about 2-3 hours for most students. During office hours, TAs 
will be available on the [App Academy Slack][app-academy-slack] organization 
to take questions and provide assistance.
