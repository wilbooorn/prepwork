Welcome to App Academy Prep! This course is designed to be completed
part-time, online, while you are employed, and starts 4 weeks before
your cycle start date. The course will take 15-20 hours a week; it will
cover the fundamentals of Ruby programming and will include a mix of
solo and pair days. TAs will be available for an hour a night
(Monday-Thursday) to answer questions.

## Pair Programming

Roughly 1/3 of the work you will do during this stage will be done in
the [pair programming][pair-programming] format. We use the same format
for most of the projects in the main course, and we've had great success
with it. Developing good habits and learning to work effectively with
your partners will greatly ease your transition to studying full-time
at App Academy.

## Feedback

During App Academy Prep, we will ask you to give feedback on your
experience completing the project. You'll be asked to evaluate your
performance and understanding, your partner's performance and
understanding, and the overall pairing experience. We will collect
similar data during the course, as well. Your feedback helps us to
improve the course and keep track of how well people are keeping up with
the material.

## Schedule

### Solo and Pair Projects

App Academy Prep will span four weeks. During the first three weeks, you
will be expected to do readings and complete coding exercises each
weeknight. We expect this work to take about 2-3 hours for most students
(or pairs). Pair programming is scheduled to take place from 6pm-9pm
PST, and TAs will be available on the [App Academy
Slack][app-academy-slack] organization to take questions and provide
assistance from 6pm-7pm.

**Note:** For pair projects, look through the readings the day before
the project is assigned. Your partners and TAs will be very upset with
you if you need to spend valuable pairing time on reviewing the
readings.  On the other hand, you should also be sure NOT to do any of
the exercises beforehand; this would make the pairing assignment rather
boring and unproductive for both you and your partner.

### Final Assessment

After going through the preparatory curriculum, students will take an
assessment. This assessment is designed to be as similar as possible to
the assessments we deliver during the main curriculum. Your performance
will not count for or against you, but you can expect it to paint a
reliable picture of the difficulty of the course. If you want to prepare
yourself to start App Academy on the right foot (and you should), then
plan to re-take the assessment on your own until you feel comfortable
with the material and can complete it well within the prescribed time
limit.
