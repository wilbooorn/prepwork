# App Academy Prep

## Pair Programming

Roughly 1/3 of the work you will do during this stage will be done in the [pair
programming][pair-programming] format. We use the same format for most of
the projects in the main course, and we've had great success with it. Getting
in the habit of pair programming effectively will greatly ease your transition
to studying full-time at App Academy.

## Feedback

During App Academy Prep, we will ask you to give feedback on your experience
completing the project. You'll be asked to evaluate your performance and
understanding, your partner's performance and understanding, and the overall
pairing experience. We will collect similar data during the course, as well.
Your feedback helps us to improve the course and keep track of how people are
doing with the material.

## Schedule

### Solo and Pair Projects

App Academy Prep will span four weeks. During the first three weeks, you will be
expected to do readings and complete assigned exercises and projects, both solo
and with a partner. We expect this work to take about 2-3 hours for most
students, and there will be assignments every weekday. Pair programming is
scheduled to take place from 6pm-9pm PST, and TAs will be available on the App
Academy Slack organization to take questions and provide assistance from
6pm-7pm.

### Final Assessment

During the fourth and final week of App Academy Prep, we will administer a live
assessment to each student. This assessment is designed to be as similar as
possible to the assessments we deliver during the main curriculum. Your
performance will not count for or against you, but you can expect it to paint a
reliable picture of the difficulty of the course. If you want to prepare
yourself to start App Academy on the right foot (and you should), then plan to
re-take the assessment on your own until you can complete it well within the
prescribed time limit.
