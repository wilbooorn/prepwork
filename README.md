Welcome to App Academy Prep! This course is designed to be completed
part-time, online, while you are employed, and should take four weeks to
complete. The course will take 15-20 hours a week; it will cover the
fundamentals of Ruby programming. TAs will hold office hours on
Monday-Thursday evenings; during that time, you have their undivided
attention. Take advantage of this resource and ask questions!

The purpose of the prep course is to make sure everyone is up-to-speed
on Ruby and basic programming concepts before your cohort begins, that
way we can hit the ground running from day 1. If you've been accepted,
you do not need to submit your prep work for review, but we expect all
students to complete the full prep course before their cohort begins.

*Note: If you've been conditionally accepted, you must submit the prep
work to us before you can schedule your final interview!*

There will be assessments throughout the course, and some of them will
test you on material from the prep-course, so be prepared. Students can
be dismissed for failing more than one assessment. The first of one
however, will **not** count against you if you fail it. It will take
place the first day of class and you should use it to assess your own
understanding of the material and to help prepare for future
assessments.

## Feedback

During App Academy Prep, we will ask you to give feedback on your
experience completing the project. You'll be asked to evaluate your
performance and understanding, as well as your interactions with the
instructional staff. We will also collect similar data during the
course. Your feedback helps us to improve the course and keep track of
how well people are keeping up with the material.

## Schedule

App Academy Prep will span four weeks. You will be expected to do
readings and complete coding exercises each weeknight. We expect this
work to take about 2-3 hours for most students. During office hours, TAs
will be available on the [App Academy Slack][app-academy-slack]
organization  to take questions and provide assistance.
