## Summary

The App Academy program is very fast-paced. If you don't have a certain
level of familiarity with programming in Ruby when you start the course
(usually 60-100hrs of practice), you will be playing catch-up for the
entire program. Some students can pull this off, but most can't and
several students have had to leave the program as a result.

For this reason, we created this short, part-time prep course covering
the fundamentals of Ruby programming. Its purpose is to make sure
everyone is up-to-speed on day 1 so that we can hit the ground running
immediately. You will need to complete and submit your work before your
cohort begins.

The information in this syllabus is important to your success in the
Prep Course and beyond, so please read it carefully.

## Schedule

This course designed to be completed part-time, online, while you are
employed and should require 15-20 hours a week for 4 weeks to complete.

The curriculum is organized into 4 weeks of readings and exercises to be
completed each weeknight. This should require 2-3 hours per day of
material.

Before this, however, there is another set of assignments labeled
"week0". These are some introductory readings and tasks that will need
to be completed before you move on to week 1.

Ideally, you will complete this in the 5-weeknights-for-4-weeks schedule
we have designed, but we recognize that many of your schedules do not
look like this. Whatever your schedule, be sure to follow the [daily
workflow][workflow] for each discreet "day" of the curriculum you
complete, whether you complete it in a single session, multiple
sessions, or crush through 2 or 3 "day"s in one huge Saturday cram
session.

## Piazza

[Piazza][piazza] is a question and answer forum geared towards
classrooms. This will be an invaluable resource for you and your primary
place to go for help, whether from App Academy TAs or fellow students
who have already struggled through the problem you're stuck on. Someone
will have an answer.

## Tutoring

App Academy runs a separate code tutoring program and some students have found it helpful to take sessions with us. Our tutors can help you if you get stuck with the prep work. We want to stress that tutoring is not required to complete the prep work.

Because we don't have the bandwidth to help everyone 1-on-1 during the prep work, we do have to charge for the service. Some students have found it helpful in the past and we want to give you the option.

You can sign up [here](http://www.appacademy.io/students/tutoring?utm_source=main_course_prep_work).

## Slack

Slack is a chat client similar to IRC. It supports public and private
channels, direct messages, formatted code blocks, and more. You should
have received an invite to join the [App Academy Prep Slack
Team][prep-course-slack]. If you did not receive an invite, please email
admin@appacademy.io and we will add you. You should either install the
desktop client, or bookmark the web version.

You can use Slack to talk with your fellow classmates about the prep
work and help each other out on the tougher concepts. You're all doing
the prep work together, so if you're struggling to wrap your head around
something, your cohort-mates will usually be willing to explain what
they understand. The reverse also holds: sometimes you'll be the one who
understands a concept that someone else is having trouble with. You're
encouraged to try to explain it as this is a great learning opportunity
for both you and the other student.

You can type `code snippets` by surrounding text in \`backticks\`. You
can also open and close multi-line code blocks like this:

    ```
    # your code goes here
    ```

## Prepwork Submission

You will be required to submit your completed prepwork before your
cohort begins. Once you are finished, please zip up the files and email
the zipfile (`.zip`) to **admin@appacademy.io** with the subject line
"`completed prepwork`". This file should include your _résumé_.

**NB:** If you've been _conditionally accepted_, you must submit the
prep work to us before you can schedule your final interview!

## Next Steps

Once you finish, check out the [list of suggestions][extra-preparation]
for how you can use the extra time to prepare yourself for the cohort.

## Assessments

Once your cohort begins, we will give assessments throughout the course,
and some of them will test you on material from the prep-course, so be
prepared. Students can be dismissed for failing more than one
assessment. On the first day of class you will take a preliminary
assessment; it will **not** count against you if you fail it, but you
should use it to assess your own understanding of the material and to
help prepare for future assessments.
